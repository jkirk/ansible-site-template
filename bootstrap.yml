# This playbook prepares the system to be managed by Ansible. There should be no need to call it more than once.
# Everything else should be handled via site.yml
#
# Make sure the following things have been done:
#
# - put the host in [site] of hosts file
# - if the given host is a PBS or PVE put the host in [proxmox] of hosts file
# - if the given host is a PBS or PVE remove the Proxmox apt sources enterprise.list file
#
#  ❯ ansible -u root --ask-pass -b -m file -a 'state=absent path=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pbs-enterprise.list' $host
#  ❯ ansible -u root --ask-pass -b -m file -a 'state=absent path=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list' $host
#
# - make sure that the variable dns_server is defined (i.e. in group_vars/all).
# - adjust users variable of the ansible role jkirk.user below
#
# NOTE: Please note that this ansible playbook fails when running with mitogen.
#
# Example:
#
#   ansible-playbook -u root bootstrap.yml
#
#   ansible-playbook -u root -ask-pass --limit $hostname bootstrap.yml
#
#   ansible-playbook -u sysadmin -b --ask-become-password -e become_user=sysadmin bootstrap.yml
