# exclude_paths included in this file are parsed relative to this file's location
# and not relative to the CWD of execution. CLI arguments passed to the --exclude
# option will be parsed relative to the CWD of execution.
exclude_paths:
  - .cache/  # implicit unless exclude_paths is defined in config
  - .github/

# This makes linter to fully ignore rules/tags listed below
skip_list:
  - meta-no-info  # meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
  - role-name  # Role name ansible-site-template does not match ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`` pattern (but it's actually not a role)
  - yaml  # Violations reported by yamllint

# List of additional kind:pattern to be added at the top of the default
# match list, first match determines the file kind.
kinds:
  - playbook: "**/site*.yml"
  - playbook: "**/bootstrap*.yml"
